This file documents the idx struct used in the ANTHEM code.
Field               Description
.elect              struct that contains electrical indices
    .dir            indices for electric Dirichlet nodes (union of .excitation and .gnd)
    .dof            indices for electric degrees of freedom
    .excitation     canonical indices of nodes at which an electric excitation is used (important for netlist extraction)
    .gnd            canonical indices of electric ground nodes (important for netlist extraction)
.therm              struct that contains thermal indices
    .dir            indices for thermal Dirichlet nodes (union of .excitation and .gnd)
    .dof            indices for thermal degrees of freedom
    .excitation     canonical indices of nodes at which a thermal excitation is used (important for netlist extraction)
    .gnd            canonical indices of thermal ground nodes (important for netlist extraction)
